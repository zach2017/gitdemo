Here’s a simpler version of the tutorial outline on GitHub and DevSecOps using GitHub Actions, designed for someone new to coding. I’ve added details and examples in easy-to-understand language.

### Tutorial: GitHub and DevSecOps Made Simple with GitHub Actions

#### 1. Getting Started
   - **What is GitHub?**
     - Think of GitHub as a place online where you save and share your code, like Google Drive for programmers.
     - Example: You write a small game in code and put it on GitHub so your friends can see it or help you improve it.
   - **What is DevSecOps?**
     - It’s a way to build code fast, keep it safe, and catch problems early—like locking your bike while riding it!
   - **What are GitHub Actions?**
     - These are like little robots that do tasks for you automatically, like checking your code or sending it to a website.
     - Example: Imagine a robot that checks your homework for spelling mistakes every time you finish a page.

#### 2. Setting Up Your GitHub Space
   - **Make a Repository**
     - Go to GitHub.com, sign in, and click “New Repository.” Name it something fun, like “MyFirstProject.”
     - It’s like creating a new folder for your code.
   - **Simple Settings**
     - Turn on “Branch Protection” (under Settings > Branches) so nobody messes up your main code by accident.
     - Example: It’s like saying only you can edit the final copy of a group project.
   - **Get It on Your Computer**
     - Download your repository with “git clone [URL]” in a terminal (a command box on your computer).
     - Example: This copies your GitHub folder to your laptop.

#### 3. What Are GitHub Actions? (In Super Simple Terms)
   - **How They Work**
     - You write instructions in a file, and the robot (GitHub Actions) follows them when something happens, like saving new code.
   - **Example File**
     - You’ll make a file called `.github/workflows/check-my-code.yml`.
     - It’s like a to-do list for the robot:
       ```
       name: Check My Code
       on: push  # Robot runs when I save new code
       jobs:
         check:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Robot uses a fresh computer
           steps:
             - run: echo "Hello, I’m working!"  # Robot says hi
       ```

#### 4. Making a Simple Pipeline (Building and Testing)
   - **What’s a Pipeline?**
     - It’s a set of steps to check and use your code, like a checklist.
   - **Step 1: Build Your Code**
     - Example: If you’re writing a website in JavaScript, add this to your file:
       ```
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Robot grabs your code
         - run: npm install  # Robot sets up tools
         - run: npm run build  # Robot builds your website
       ```
   - **Step 2: Test It**
     - Add a test step:
       ```
       - run: npm test  # Robot checks if your code works
       ```
     - Example: If your code is a calculator, this makes sure 2 + 2 equals 4.

#### 5. Adding Safety Checks (The “Sec” in DevSecOps)
   - **Why Safety Matters**
     - You don’t want hackers sneaking into your code, like keeping your diary locked.
   - **Simple Safety Check**
     - Use a free tool called CodeQL to find problems:
       ```
       steps:
         - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2  # Robot starts safety tool
         - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2  # Robot checks for issues
       ```
     - Example: It’s like a teacher checking your homework for mistakes you didn’t see.
   - **Secret Protection**
     - GitHub already watches for passwords you accidentally save. Don’t write “mysecretpassword123” in your code!

#### 6. Writing Your First Full Robot Instructions
   - **Your File**
     ```
     name: My First Pipeline
     on: push  # Runs when you save code
     jobs:
       build-and-check:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Get code
           - run: npm install  # Set up
           - run: npm test  # Test it
           - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2  # Safety check
           - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
     ```
   - **What This Does**
     - Every time you save code, the robot tests it and checks for safety problems.

#### 7. Seeing It Work
   - **Run It**
     - Save your file to `.github/workflows/` in your repository and push it to GitHub.
     - Go to the “Actions” tab on GitHub to watch the robot work.
   - **Fixing Problems**
     - If the robot says “test failed,” look at the error (e.g., “2 + 2 gave 5!”) and fix your code.
     - Example: Change `2 + 2 = 5` to `2 + 2 = 4` and try again.

#### 8. Making It Even Better
   - **Speed It Up**
     - Add caching so the robot doesn’t redo everything:
       ```
       - uses: actions/cache@v3
         with:
           path: node_modules
           key: ${{ runner.os }}-node
       ```
     - Example: It’s like saving your pencils so you don’t buy new ones every day.
   - **Get Notified**
     - Add a step to tell you if it fails (e.g., via email through GitHub settings).

#### 9. Wrapping Up
   - **What You Learned**
     - How to save code on GitHub, use robots to check it, and keep it safe.
   - **Why It’s Cool**
     - You can share safe, working code with friends or the world!
   - **Next Steps**
     - Try adding more tests or making a small website.

#### 10. Try It Yourself
   - **Mini Project**
     - Make a repository with a simple file (e.g., `index.js` with `console.log("Hi!")`).
     - Add the robot file from Step 6.
     - Push it to GitHub and watch it run in the “Actions” tab.
